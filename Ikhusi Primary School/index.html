               <p>The school opened its doors in 1999 in response to the shortage of quality Maths and Science matriculants from township schools in the Western Cape. Initially, Louwville offered only Grades 10 to 12 and students with mathematical talent would be invited to leave their high schools at the end of Grade 9 to complete their school careers at Louwville.

                The first matric class in 2001 set the precedent for the future with a 100% online casino NG pass rate, an exemption rate of close to 70% and an impressive number of subject distinctions.
                
                For the next ten years the school cemented its reputation as a centre of excellence and, as a result, the Western Cape Education Department [WCED] gave it the status of a STEM school [Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths Focus School], one of four in the province, and provided new buildings and the opportunity to expand to include all senior grades. As a result, COSAT became a more conventional secondary school in 2011, and its student complement has grown from + 200 to 550 in the last two years.
